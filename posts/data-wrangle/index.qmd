## Introduction

### What do we mean with data wrangling?

The Cambridge dictionary gives several meanings to the verb [wrangle](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/wrangle):

1. to argue with someone about something, especially for a long time

2. to take care of, control, or move animals, especially large animals such as cows or horses (*mainly American English*)

3. to move a person or thing somewhere, usually with difficulty or using force 

4. to take care of or **deal with something, usually when this is difficult**


### Data Wrangling

By data wrangling, we mean here the process of checking and correcting quality and 
integrity of data relevant to malaria modeling, prior to any further analysis. 
This is also known as data validation.

**Data validation** involves checking various aspects of your dataset, such as missing values, 
data types, outliers, and adherence to specific rules or constraints. 

Validating our data helps maintain its **quality and integrity**, ensuring that any 
analyses or decisions made based on the data are robust and reliable.


### Why Validate Data?

Ensure Data **Integrity**: Validating data helps identify and rectify errors, ensuring the integrity of the dataset.

Improve Analysis **Accuracy**: Clean and validated data leads to more accurate analysis and modeling results.

Compliance and **Standards**: Data validation ensures that the data conforms to predefined rules, standards, or regulatory requirements.

Error **Prevention**: Early detection of errors can prevent downstream issues and save time in troubleshooting.


## Getting Started

Before you begin, you might want to create a new project in RStudio. This can be done by clicking on the "New Project" button in the upper right corner of the RStudio window. You can then name the project and choose a directory to save it in.

Next, we will load the `tidyverse` package. This package provides a set of useful functions for data manipulation and visualization. We will use the `ggplot2` package to create plots in the later section of this tutorial.


```{r load-packages}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
# load packages
library(tidyverse)
```

Next, let's download the two example datasets we will use in this tutorial. These are available in the [AMMnet Hackathon GitHub repository](https://github.com/AMMnet/AMMnet-Hackathon). 

I suggest creating a `data` folder inside your R project, then we can download the two example datasets so that they are saved to your computer.

```{r load-data}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| eval: false
# Create a data folder
dir.create("data")

# Download example data
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AMMnet/AMMnet-Hackathon/main/02_data-wrangle/data/"

download.file(paste0(url, "mockdata_cases1.csv"), destfile = "data/mockdata_cases1.csv")
download.file(paste0(url, "mosq_mock1.csv"), destfile = "data/mosq_mock1.csv")

# Load example data
data_cases   <- read_csv("data/mockdata_cases1.csv")
mosq_data  <- read_csv("data/mosq_mock1.csv")
```

```{r load-local}
#| echo: false
# Load example data
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AMMnet/AMMnet-Hackathon/main/02_data-wrangle/data/"
data_cases   <- read_csv(paste0(url, "mockdata_cases1.csv"), col_types = cols())
mosq_data  <- read_csv(paste0(url, "mosq_mock1.csv"), col_types = cols())
```

The two datasets we will use are `mockdata_cases1.csv` and `mosq_mock1.csv`, which are mock example datasets that should be similar to malaria case surveillance and mosquito field collection data, respectively. In the following sections we will use the `mockdata_cases1.csv` and `mosq_mock1.csv` to introduce concepts of data cleaning and characterization in R. 

## 1.  Check the data for potential errors

### Prevalence is a fraction defined in [0,1]

**Note:** Prevalence of 0 or 1 while not statistically erroneous, need checking for accuracy.

What observations have errors?
```{r data-prevalence}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| eval: true
# Erroneous values for prevalence
data_cases%>%
   dplyr::filter(prev <= 0 | prev >= 1)
```
**Comment:** We have two rows with nonsensical `prev` data `25.3`and `-0.455`, and one row with zero `prev` at a given month. 


### Defensive programming

**Note:** The use of "::" enables us to call a function from a specific R package
       I have had instances where if "stats" base R package was called first, 
       the filter function if not specified with the R package fails.
```{r data-statsfilter}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| eval: false
# Erroneous values for prevalence
data_cases%>%
    stats::filter(prev < 0 | prev > 1) 
```

### We correct the two prevalence by re-calculating 

Good practice to leave the original data intact (advantage of R over Stata)

```{r data-prevalence-update}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| eval: true
# Update erroneous values for prevalence
data_prev <- data_cases%>%
                       dplyr::mutate(prev_updated=positive/total)
```
We have a case erroneously reported with a negative value.

What are your options?

1. Never delete data

2. Query and have data management team make the necessary investigations and make a correction

```{r data-prevalence-update-filter}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| eval: true
data_prev%>%
    dplyr::filter(prev_updated <= 0 | prev_updated >= 1)
```

For now (in order to proceed with this demo), we drop the problematic observation.

Why is this not working?
```{r data-prevalence_filterwrong}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| eval: true
# Filter erroneous values for prevalence, wrong way
data_use <- data_prev%>%
              dplyr::filter (prev_updated >= 0 | prev_updated <= 1)
```
Why is this working?
```{r data-prevalence_filterright}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| eval: true
# Filter erroneous values for prevalence
data_use <- data_prev%>%
             dplyr::filter (prev_updated >= 0 )%>%
              dplyr::filter (prev_updated <= 1)

data_use%>%
       dplyr::filter(prev_updated <= 0 | prev_updated >= 1)
```

### Schemas

To prevent nonsensical data appearing in your data, you should define
a **schema** that comes along with your recorded data. A schema is a document that 
states rules for data types and values or ranges to be expected in a particular 
column of your data frame. 

E.g. for prevalence, we know that this should be a real number between 
zero and one.

The R package `validate` can be used to create a schema for your data frame:

```{r data-validation-schema}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| eval: true
# Filter erroneous values for prevalence
library(validate)
schema <- validate::validator(prev >= 0,
                   prev <= 1,
                   positive >= 0)

out   <- validate::confront(data_cases, schema)
summary(out)
```
Using the schema for the columns `prev` and `positive`, we could have readily detected 
the three problematic entries. For more details, you can have a look into the
[vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/validate/vignettes/cookbook.html) 
of the `validate` package.

**Note:** Next time when you receive data from your collaborators, you might want to
ask them for the associated schema file (e.g. YAML format). Good luck!

## 2.  Look at summary statistics
### Summary stats by location (across all time points)

```{r data-prevalence_summary}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| eval: true
# Summary statistics 

data_use%>%
   dplyr::group_by(location)%>%
     dplyr::summarise(nobs=n(),
                      mean_prev=mean(prev_updated),
                      min_prev=min(prev_updated),
                      max_prev=max(prev_updated))
```

### Summary stats by location and year (across all time points)

Table getting longer. Might be too cumbersome to add checks by month and age group
Note: point of query - why just had 3 measurements in 2020? 

```{r data-prevalence_summary_location}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| eval: true
# Summary statistics by location
data_use%>%
  dplyr::group_by(location, year)%>%
  dplyr::summarise(nobs=n(),
                   mean_prev=mean(prev_updated),
                   min_prev=min(prev_updated),
                   max_prev=max(prev_updated))
```

::: {#challenge1 .callout-tip}
## Challenge 1: Explore the `data_prev` and `data_use` datasets
* Create a table showing the number of data entries per age group and location for each of them!
* Which age group and location have observations removed?
:::


Slightly more advanced. Use of lists (not scope of the course but there is a point here).
```{r data-prevalence_summary_list}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| eval: true
# Summary statistics by location
data_use_list <- data_use%>%
                  dplyr::group_split(location)
```
Or use the `purrr` library:
```{r data-prevalence_summary_list_purrr}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| eval: true
# Summary statistics by location, map summary function
library(purrr)

data_use_age_summary <- purrr::map(.x=seq(length(data_use_list)),
                                   .f=function(x){
                                     data_use_list[[x]]%>%
                                       dplyr::group_by(location,year,ages)%>%
                                       dplyr::summarise(nobs=n(),
                                                        mean_prev=mean(prev_updated),
                                                        min_prev=min(prev_updated),
                                                        max_prev=max(prev_updated)) 
                                     
                                   })
```  

### Now let's focus on the first list object (mordor)                         
We know pregnant mothers, children <5 are most vulnerable.

Output (ages) isn't ordered as we would want (chronologically).
```{r data-mordor_prev}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| eval: true
# Summary statistics by location

data_mordor <- data_use_age_summary[[1]]

data_mordor
```

### How to proceed?

```{r data-mordor_prev_age}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| eval: true
# Summary statistics with age groups
age_order <- c("under_5","5_to_14","15_above")

data_use_ordered <- data_use

data_use_ordered$age_group <- factor(data_use$ages, levels =age_order)

data_mordor_reordered <- data_use_ordered%>%
                           dplyr::group_by(location, year,age_group)%>%
                            dplyr::summarise(nobs=n(),
                                             mean_prev=mean(prev_updated),
                                             min_prev=min(prev_updated),
                                             max_prev=max(prev_updated))%>%
                                 dplyr::filter(location=="mordor")
```
Let's compare the two
```{r data-mordor_prev_comp}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| eval: true
# Compare for Mordor

data_mordor
data_mordor_reordered

```



## 3.  Use of graphs
### We need to assess the evolution of prevalence for all regions by month

```{r data-evoplot}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| eval: true
#Plotting evolution over time
evolution_plot <- ggplot2::ggplot(data=data_use_ordered,
                                  mapping=aes(x=month,
                                              y=prev_updated,
                                              group=location,
                                              colour=location))+
                        ggplot2::geom_line(lwd=1.1)+
                           ggplot2::facet_wrap(~year)+ 
                            ggplot2::theme_bw()+
                             ggplot2::xlab("Month of the Year")+
                               ggplot2::ylab("Prevalence")+
                                ggplot2::scale_x_discrete(limits=factor(1:12),
                                                          labels=c("J","F","M",
                                                                   "A","M","J",
                                                                   "J","A","S",
                                                                   "O","N","D"))+
                                   ggplot2::scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(from=0,
                                                                          to=0.7,
                                                                          by=0.1))

evolution_plot
```

**Observation:** Prevalence graph with vertical lines per month and year, means we have several subgroups for prevalence data, we plot facets for levels of `age_group`
```{r data-evoplot-fix1}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| eval: true
#Plotting evolution over time, fix 1
evolution_plot_ages <- ggplot2::ggplot(data=data_use_ordered,
                                  mapping=aes(x=month,
                                              y=prev_updated,
                                              group=location,
                                              colour=location))+
  ggplot2::geom_line(lwd=1.1)+
  ggplot2::facet_wrap(age_group~year)+ 
  ggplot2::theme_bw()+
  ggplot2::xlab("Month of the Year")+
  ggplot2::ylab("Prevalence")+
  ggplot2::scale_x_discrete(limits=factor(1:12),
                            labels=c("J","F","M",
                                     "A","M","J",
                                     "J","A","S",
                                     "O","N","D"))+
  ggplot2::scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(from=0,
                                         to=0.7,
                                         by=0.1))

evolution_plot_ages
```
**Observation**: 
Some improvements, but we still have vertical lines, maybe we have other group variables. Let's only look at those rows that have more than one entry per location, month, year, age_group

```{r data-evoplot-fix2}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| eval: true
#Plotting evolution over time, fix 2

data_use_ordered%>%
  group_by(location,month,year,age_group)%>%
  tally()%>%
  filter(n>1)%>%
  left_join(data_use_ordered)
```
**Observation:** 
OK, we see that within one location there are several prevalence data points, they differ by the `xcoord` and `ycoord`. In order to plot by location, we could average across `xcoord` and `ycoord` witin each location; maybe those are duplicated recordings, since `xcoord` and `ycoord` are very close?

```{r data-evoplot-fix3}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| eval: true
#Plotting evolution over time, fix 3

data_use_ordered%>%
  group_by(location,month,year,age_group)%>%
  summarize(prev_updated_mean=mean(prev_updated),
            prev_updated_min=min(prev_updated),
            prev_updated_max=max(prev_updated))%>%
  ggplot2::ggplot(mapping=aes(x=month,
                              y=prev_updated_mean,
                              file=location,
                              group=location,
                              colour=location))+
  ggplot2::geom_line(lwd=1.1)+
  ggplot2::facet_wrap(age_group~year)+ 
  ggplot2::theme_bw()+
  ggplot2::xlab("Month of the Year")+
  ggplot2::ylab("Prevalence")+
  ggplot2::scale_x_discrete(limits=factor(1:12),
                            labels=c("J","F","M",
                                     "A","M","J",
                                     "J","A","S",
                                     "O","N","D"))+
  ggplot2::scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(from=0,
                                         to=0.7,
                                         by=0.1))
```
**Observation:** 
Prevalence widely variable throughout they year across the locations on average, wonderland affected by high prevalence while oz has the lowest prevalence


# Need to check (not just prevalence) but count of cases and total vulnerable

                                                    ggplot2::ylab("Count")

mordor_stacked_bar_graph
```
**Observation:** 
Stacked bar graph adds positive and total counts, better to show  them side by side as positive counts are a subset of the total counts. This is a specified by the argument `position="dodge"` in the `geom_bar` geometry of `ggplot2`.

```{r data-casecount-dodgedbar}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| eval: true

## The mosquito data set

Let's take a look at the `mosq_data`dataset.

We check the sanity of this data set by displaying a table of recorded values per column:
```{r data-mosqdata-table}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| eval: true
mosq_data %>%
  map( function(x) table(x) )
```
Looks like we have some typos in the names for `Method` and `Village`.

::: {#challenge2 .callout-tip}
## Challenge 2: Using schemas for the mosquito data set

* Create a *schema* that provides rules for the strings (i.e. words) to be expected 
in the columns `Method` and `Village`.
* Use the syntax from [here](#data-validation-schema)
:::

```{r data-mosqdata-valid}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| eval: true
schema <- validate::validator(Method%in%c("HLC"),
                              Village%in%c("narnia"))

out   <- validate::confront(mosq_data, schema)
summary(out)
```



The columns `Village` and `Method` seem to have some data entry errors. We need to correct for that.
```{r data-mosqdata-correct}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| eval: true
mosq_data<-mosq_data%>%
  mutate(Method=ifelse(Method=="ALC","HLC",Method),
         Village=ifelse(Village=="naernia","narnia",Village))
```

It looks like the several columns concern *Anopheles Gambiae* population sizes. Let's change the column names using `rename` from the `tidyverse` package.
```{r data-mosqdata-names}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| eval: true
mosq_data%>%
  rename("AnophelesGambiae.male"="ag.Male",
         "AnophelesGambiae.unfed"="Ag.unfed",
         "AnophelesGambiae.halffed"="Ag.halffed",
         "AnophelesGambiae.fed"="Ag.fed",
         "AnophelesGambiae.gravid"="Ag.grsgr")->mosq_data
```

Seems like the `tot.gamb` should count the the total number of Anopheles 
Gambiae populations. Let's check:
```{r data-mosqdata-total}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| eval: true
mosq_data%>%
  mutate(AnophelesGambiae_total=AnophelesGambiae.male+AnophelesGambiae.unfed+AnophelesGambiae.halffed+AnophelesGambiae.fed+AnophelesGambiae.gravid)->mosq_data

mosq_data%>%
  filter(AnophelesGambiae_total!=tot.gamb)%>%select(AnophelesGambiae_total,tot.gamb)
```
OK, so 11 out of 104 rows have this discrepancy. Let's keep rather `Anopheles.total`,
since it was calculated from the data.

Since the status of the Anopheles is mutually exclusive in the HLC data, we can draw
a stacked bar chart, with the bar color defined by the status. To produce such 
a graph efficiently in `ggplot2`, we need to pivot the table.

Here in particular we want to switch from a wide format to a long format  table 
in order to obtain a column describing the status of the Anopheles mosquitoes.
We will use in particular the `names_sep`argument of the `pivot_longer` function
to separate e.g. the column name `AnophelesGambiae.male` and use `male`as level
in a new column called `status`. The same goes for other column names. 

Setting the grouping variable to `session`, `Village`, `Compound.ID`, `Method`, 
`Location`, `hour`, `AnophelesGambiae_total` will help to keep those variables 
in the long format table.

```{r data-mosqdata-pivot}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| eval: true
mosq_data%>%
  group_by(session,Village,Compound.ID,Method,Location,hour,AnophelesGambiae_total)%>%
  select(contains("AnophelesGambiae."))%>%
  pivot_longer(cols=contains("AnophelesGambiae."),names_sep="AnophelesGambiae.",names_to=c(NA,"status"),values_to = "AnophelesGambiae")->mosq_data_gamb_wide

mosq_data_gamb_wide%>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_bar(aes(x=hour,y=AnophelesGambiae,fill=status),position="stack",stat="identity")+
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(angle = 60))
```
**Observation**: We had several values for `Compound.ID`. The `geom_bar` geometry
is automatically adding them up in the graph. We can use `facet_wrap`to see those
strata:
```{r data-mosqdata-pivot-line}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| eval: true

mosq_data_gamb_wide%>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_bar(aes(x=hour,y=AnophelesGambiae,fill=status),position="stack",stat="identity")+
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(angle = 60))+
  facet_wrap(~Compound.ID)
```
On we can also use our variable `Anopheles_total` and plot is as a line graph on top
of the bar graph:

```{r data-mosqdata-pivot-disagg}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| eval: true
mosq_data_gamb_wide%>%
  mutate(grouping=paste0(Compound.ID,Location,session))%>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_bar(aes(x=hour,y=AnophelesGambiae,fill=status),position="stack",stat="identity")+
  geom_line(aes(x=hour,y=AnophelesGambiae_total,group=grouping))+
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(angle = 60))+
  facet_wrap(~Compound.ID+session+Location)
```
